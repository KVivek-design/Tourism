		<p>Goa, the land of beaches, is the smallest state in India and yet, arguably, the biggest tourist destination of the country. 
		There is hardly a list of best places to visit in India that doesn’t feature Goa at the very top. The beaches, the markets, 
		the parties and the natural beauty of this land on the west coast of India is what mesmerizes everyone.Goa became part of 
		the hippie trail during the ’70s. Anjuna was the destination everyone headed to. </p>

		<p>Over the years though, Goa has become more hip than hippie.
		A blend of Portuguese and Indian influences, Goa’s unique history makes it a place much more than just beaches and parties.
		Goa is distinctly divided into North Goa and South Goa. Arambol, Mandrem, Morjim, Vagator, Anjuna, Baga, Calangute, Candolim and Miramar 
		are just some of the most popular beaches in north Goa. While the beaches of north Goa are considered ideal for beach holidays, 
		those in south Goa are known for their scenic splendor.</p>


		<p>Be it the beautiful Palolem beach or the quiet Patnem, you are assured of a splendid vacation. Goa also offers a number of water sports;
		Baga and Calangute being two of the best destinations. These top five beaches of Goa should not be missed during your visit.</p>

		<p>When you get away from the beaches towards the interiors, you will be amazed by the beautiful churches of Old Goa. Basilica de Bom Jesus, 
		Se Cathedral and  Church of St. Francis of Assisi will take you back in time. Panaji, the capital of Goa is known for its old world charm.
		The heritage houses at Altinho and Fontainhas, the old Latin Quarter in Panaji will take you back in time. Miramar Beach and Dona Paula are 
		other popular places around Panaji.</p>

		<p>This is located in the Western Ghats zone at an altitude of 2240 mtrs. It is the headquarters of the Nilgiri District, 
		where the two mountain ranges meet. Udhagamandalam , popularly called as OOTY by the tourist, is the Queen of Hill Stations.
		Centuries ago this was also called as Oththai-Kal [single stone] Mandu [ Mund is a name of Toda Village].   Curiously enough, this slice of paradise remained 
		unknown even during the periods of the great Southern Dynasties. 
		</p>

		<p>The British started calling it as Ootacamund. Coffee and Tea Plantations and trees like Conifers, Eucalyptus, Pine and 
		Wattle dot the hill side in Udhagamandalam and its environs. Summer temperature is maximum of 25 C and a minimum of 10 C .</p>


		<p>During the Winter it is minimum 5 C and a maximum of 21 C when it is slightly warmer. This area was inhibited by the tribals
		called TODA long before any body could venture into this region.</p>

		<p>It was the Britons who ventured into the riches of the regions during early 1800’s. Development and modernization took after 
		their arrival to Udhagamandalam. This was the Summer Capital of the Madras Presidency during the British Rule. Coonoor - 19Kms, 
		Kothagiri - 31 Kms are the other smaller nearby hill stations.The Town population is 88,430(2011 census) and Nilgiri District 
		population is 7,33,394(2011 census).</p>
