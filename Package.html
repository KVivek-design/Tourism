		<p>Goa, the land of beaches, is the smallest state in India and yet, arguably, the biggest tourist destination of the country. 
		There is hardly a list of best places to visit in India that doesn’t feature Goa at the very top. The beaches, the markets, 
		the parties and the natural beauty of this land on the west coast of India is what mesmerizes everyone.Goa became part of 
		the hippie trail during the ’70s. Anjuna was the destination everyone headed to. </p>
		<img src="images (2).jpeg" height="2%" width="2%" align="right">
		<p>Over the years though, Goa has become more hip than hippie.
		A blend of Portuguese and Indian influences, Goa’s unique history makes it a place much more than just beaches and parties.
		Goa is distinctly divided into North Goa and South Goa. Arambol, Mandrem, Morjim, Vagator, Anjuna, Baga, Calangute, Candolim and Miramar 
		are just some of the most popular beaches in north Goa. While the beaches of north Goa are considered ideal for beach holidays, 
		those in south Goa are known for their scenic splendor.</p>


		<p>Be it the beautiful Palolem beach or the quiet Patnem, you are assured of a splendid vacation. Goa also offers a number of water sports;
		Baga and Calangute being two of the best destinations. These top five beaches of Goa should not be missed during your visit.</p>

		<p>When you get away from the beaches towards the interiors, you will be amazed by the beautiful churches of Old Goa. Basilica de Bom Jesus, 
		Se Cathedral and  Church of St. Francis of Assisi will take you back in time. Panaji, the capital of Goa is known for its old world charm.
		The heritage houses at Altinho and Fontainhas, the old Latin Quarter in Panaji will take you back in time. Miramar Beach and Dona Paula are 
		other popular places around Panaji.</p>

		<p>This is located in the Western Ghats zone at an altitude of 2240 mtrs. It is the headquarters of the Nilgiri District, 
		where the two mountain ranges meet. Udhagamandalam , popularly called as OOTY by the tourist, is the Queen of Hill Stations.
		Centuries ago this was also called as Oththai-Kal [single stone] Mandu [ Mund is a name of Toda Village].   Curiously enough, this slice of paradise remained 
		unknown even during the periods of the great Southern Dynasties. 
		</p>
		<img src="images.jpeg" height="450" width="150" align="right">
		<p>The British started calling it as Ootacamund. Coffee and Tea Plantations and trees like Conifers, Eucalyptus, Pine and 
		Wattle dot the hill side in Udhagamandalam and its environs. Summer temperature is maximum of 25 C and a minimum of 10 C .</p>


		<p>During the Winter it is minimum 5 C and a maximum of 21 C when it is slightly warmer. This area was inhibited by the tribals
		called TODA long before any body could venture into this region.</p>

		<p>It was the Britons who ventured into the riches of the regions during early 1800’s. Development and modernization took after 
		their arrival to Udhagamandalam. This was the Summer Capital of the Madras Presidency during the British Rule. Coonoor - 19Kms, 
		Kothagiri - 31 Kms are the other smaller nearby hill stations.The Town population is 88,430(2011 census) and Nilgiri District 
		population is 7,33,394(2011 census).</p>

		<p><br><br><br>Hidimba Devi Temple, Solang, Rohtang Pass, Bhrigu Lake, Pandoh Dam, Manali Sanctuary, Beas River, 
		Hamta Pass and Great Himalayan National Park are among the famous places.
		</p>
		<img src="unnamed.jpg" height="500px" width="100px" align="right">
		<p>Hadimba Temple: It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, who was a character in the Indian epic, Mahābhārata.
		The temple is surrounded by a beautiful cedar forest (Dhungri Van Vihar) at the foot of the Himālayas. The sanctuary is built 
		over a huge rock jutting out of the ground, which was worshipped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in the year 1553.
		If you're walking to the temple you can take a short cut up the hill through the woods instead of walking along the road.</p>


		<p>Jogini Falls: About a 2km trek from Vashisth Temple. 
		Going to the top of the falls would need a guide and quite a bit of trekking, but if you wish you could just keep asking for 
		directions from Vashishth temple and reach the first level of the falls.
		</p>

		<p>Rahala waterfalls: About 16km from Manali at the start of the climb to the Rohtang Pass, are the beautiful Rahalla Falls at
		an altitude of 2,501m.
